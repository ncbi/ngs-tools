ngs-tools::Sequence Taxonomic Analysis Tool (STAT)
===

### Description 
* ### STAT is a collection of tools for building `k-mer` databases, and querying against them.

### Quick start guide
* ### Run quickbuild.sh to build only the files for minimum functionality.
* ### Go to ./examples folder and run build_db_and_run.sh shell script. 
* ### Read build_db_and_run.sh: it is richly annotated with comments about each step performed.
  * (NOTE: requires python3 for successful script execution.)

* ### If want all the tools you can run ./build.sh from any folder.
